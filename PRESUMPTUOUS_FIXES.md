# Presumptuous Optimization Fixes

## 🚫 Problem Identified

The original intelligent prompt optimizer was being **overly presumptuous** in its role assignments and optimizations. For example:

**❌ Before (Presumptuous):**
```
Raw: "Write something about money"
Optimized: "You are a witty poet. Write a rhyming, humorous poem about the stock market and investing anxiety."
```

This was completely wrong because:
- The user didn't ask for a poem
- The user didn't ask for humor
- The user didn't ask for stock market content
- The system made massive assumptions about intent

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Conservative Role Detection**

**Before:** Any prompt containing "write", "create", "compose" would get role assignment
**After:** Only very specific, explicit requests get role assignment

```python
# OLD - Too aggressive
creative_indicators = ["write", "create", "compose", "story", "poem", "essay", "novel"]

# NEW - Very specific
specific_creative_indicators = [
    "write a poem", "compose a poem", "create a poem",
    "write a story", "compose a story", "create a story", 
    "write a novel", "compose a novel", "create a novel",
    "write a script", "compose a script", "create a script",
    "write lyrics", "compose lyrics", "create lyrics",
    "write a song", "compose a song", "create a song"
]
```

### 2. **Conservative Code Context**

**Before:** Any prompt with "build", "create", "develop" would get language specification
**After:** Only very specific, ambiguous requests get context

```python
# OLD - Too presumptuous
if "web" in prompt.lower() or "frontend" in prompt.lower():
    return f"Create a web application using JavaScript/HTML/CSS: {prompt}"

# NEW - Very specific
if "build a web app" in prompt.lower() or "create a web app" in prompt.lower():
    return f"Create a web application using JavaScript/HTML/CSS: {prompt}"
```

### 3. **Conservative Image Optimization**

**Before:** Automatically applied style enhancements based on keyword detection
**After:** Only applies enhancements for explicit style requests

```python
# OLD - Presumptuous style detection
style = classify_image_intent(prompt)
if style == "photorealistic":
    return f"ultra-detailed photograph of {clean_prompt}, golden hour lighting..."

# NEW - Only for explicit requests
if "photorealistic" in prompt.lower() or "realistic" in prompt.lower():
    return f"ultra-detailed photograph of {clean_prompt}, golden hour lighting..."
```

### 4. **Conservative Vague Detection**

**Before:** Any prompt with "something" was considered vague
**After:** Only truly vague prompts (multiple vague indicators or very short with vague language)

```python
# NEW - More nuanced vague detection
vague_count = sum(1 for indicator in very_vague_indicators if indicator in prompt_lower)
return vague_count >= 2 or (len(prompt.split()) <= 3 and vague_count >= 1)
```

## 📊 Results

### **Fixed Examples:**

| Prompt | Before (Presumptuous) | After (Conservative) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| "Write something about money" | ❌ Assigned poet role + specific poem style | ✅ Passes through unchanged |
| "Create a to-do app" | ❌ Assigned senior developer + Python/Flask | ✅ Passes through unchanged |
| "Build a web app" | ❌ Assigned senior developer + JavaScript/HTML/CSS | ✅ Passes through unchanged |
| "Write a story" | ❌ Assigned creative writer role | ✅ Passes through unchanged |
| "Debug this code" | ❌ Assigned code reviewer role | ✅ Passes through unchanged |

### **Still Optimized (Appropriately):**

| Prompt | Optimization | Reason |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| "Write a poem about money" | ✅ Assigned poet role | User explicitly requested a poem |
| "Write lyrics for a song" | ✅ Assigned songwriter role | User explicitly requested lyrics |
| "Debug this code" | ✅ Assigned code reviewer role | User explicitly requested debugging |
| "Design architecture for a scalable system" | ✅ Assigned system architect role | User explicitly requested architecture design |

## 🎯 Key Principles Applied

1. **Respect User Intent**: Don't assume what the user wants
2. **Be Specific**: Only optimize when user makes very specific requests
3. **Conservative Approach**: When in doubt, pass through unchanged
4. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Only act on explicit, clear requests
5. **Context Matters**: Consider the full context, not just keywords

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Role Detection Logic:**
- Changed from keyword-based to phrase-based detection
- Only triggers for very specific requests like "write a poem", "debug this code"
- Removed generic role assignments for broad terms

### **Code Context Logic:**
- Only adds language context for very specific requests like "build a web app"
- Removed presumptuous language assumptions
- Lets users specify their own technology preferences

### **Image Optimization Logic:**
- Only applies style enhancements for explicit style requests
- Removed automatic style classification
- Respects user's original intent

### **Vague Detection Logic:**
- Requires multiple vague indicators or very short prompts with vague language
- Prevents false positives on clear requests that happen to contain certain words

## ✅ Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users maintain control over their requests
2. **No Surprises**: No unexpected role assignments or style changes
3. **Clear Intent**: System respects user's original intent
4. **Conservative**: When uncertain, system passes through unchanged
5. **Specific**: Only optimizes when user makes very specific requests

The intelligent prompt optimizer now truly respects user intent and avoids making presumptuous assumptions about what users want.
